=====================
### Assets:

website is currently hosted on github pages: [current address](https://zyyan20h.github.io/relatedWork_repo/#top)
new entries can be submitted through [this google form](https://forms.gle/zLiBXeF5D7XkV2fNA)
the form and corresponding google sheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yaZWr2U66JCPy5NssvbX-qGEgytAyVl8ftS4V2UGxPs/edit?usp=sharing)

for us the maintenance team to approve and load the enties, we need to:

1. go to the "backend" google sheet that is acting as a database with [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yaZWr2U66JCPy5NssvbX-qGEgytAyVl8ftS4V2UGxPs/edit?usp=sharing);
2. go to the "response" sheet that is linked with the reponses;
3. find entries that is not marked as approved in column L;
4. make sure all information is filled in correct;
5. click "manage data" (from the tool bar) --> "update web data", this will run a script that update any non-duplicate approved entries into the "webData" sheet, and will be automatically picked up by the js script running the page.
